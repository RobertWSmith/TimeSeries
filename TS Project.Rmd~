# Background

I intend to forecast Vehicle Miles Travelled (millions of miles). I accessed historical data from the [Federal Reserve Economic Data](https://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/TRFVOLUSM227NFWA/downloaddata?cid=33202). 

Upon initial analysis it was apparent that there is a high degree of seasonality within the data set, and over the time frame investigated (1970 - 2013) there is also a fairly significant overall upward trend.

```{r initial}

vmt <- read.csv("FRED_VMT.csv")
names(vmt) <- c("date", "value")

vmt_ts <- xts( x = vmt$value, order.by = ymd(vmt$date)


```
